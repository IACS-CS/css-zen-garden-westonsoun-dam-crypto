# Project Imitation

In this project, you will be creating your own CSS stylesheet for the [IACS CSS Zen Garden](https://iacs-zen-garden.netlify.app/).

The game is simple: show just how much you can do using only CSS to create a unique look and feel for a page. You may *not* edit the `index.html` file.

The Zen Garden itself contains the project instructions, but here they are again for your reference:

## Requirements

- Create at least one beautiful design
- Make the design selector menu beautiful and usable
- Use images and color wisely in your design

## Honors Requirements

- Make your designs responsive
- Create 3 unique designs using at least two different approaches to layout.

## Rubric

### Minimum Requirements (3)
- Customized typography, colors and layout (no defaults left on the page)
- Add basic design to the "menus" to make them look like an intentional menu and not just a list of links.
- Make effective use of "CRAP" design principles (Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, Proximity).
- Use of AI and other resources is cited in the CSS file comments.
- Use of external resources (fonts, images, etc.) is cited in the CSS file comments.

### Full Requirements (4)
- All minimum requirements met.
- Makes use of a variety of CSS techniques (e.g., positioning, flexbox, grid, pseudo-elements, etc.).
- Design is visually appealing and demonstrates thoughtful use of design principles.
- Thoughtfully chosen custom fonts and color palettes used throughout.
- Code is well-organized and commented for readability.
- Use of external resources or AI is cited in a way that is visibly integrated into the design using CSS ::after or ::before pseudo-elements.

### Honors Requirements
- All full requirements met.
- Designs are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop).
- At least 3 unique designs created, each demonstrating significantly different approaches to layout.
- At least 1 design incorporates advanced CSS techniques (e.g., animations, transitions, transforms, some "wow" factor).
